For our final group project, we looked into Airbnbs in Hong Kong and tried to create a regression model to predict the price for 4 nights for two people at an Airbnb. I am originally from Hong Kong, so this analyis was enlightening and fun at the same time as I got to understand more about Hong Kong's Airbnb market and how different varibles would affect prices.

For this section, let's look deeper into Hong Kong's Airbnb data!

## Hong Kong Airbnb data

Let's load Hong Kong's Airbnb data and take a look at the different variables of the dataset.

```{r data_upload, tidy=TRUE}

#loading data
listings <- read.csv("~/Desktop/CA09 AUT 20 Data Analytics for Finance/GitHub/my_website/data/listings.csv")
listings <- listings %>% 
              clean_names()

glimpse(listings)
```

Since there are a lot of variables and not all of them are helpful. We create a new dataframe hong_kong_listings with only important variables selected. We also convert characters to doubles and factors where appropriate. In addition, we create a new variable prop_type_simplified so we can easily analyze the different types of accommodation available.

```{r select variables}

hong_kong_listings <- listings %>% 
  select(id, host_id, host_since,host_is_superhost,host_listings_count,neighbourhood_cleansed,property_type,room_type,
         accommodates,bathrooms,bedrooms,beds,bed_type,price,security_deposit,cleaning_fee,guests_included,
         extra_people,minimum_nights,maximum_nights,number_of_reviews,reviews_per_month,number_of_reviews_ltm,review_scores_rating,
         review_scores_accuracy,review_scores_cleanliness,review_scores_checkin,review_scores_communication,review_scores_location,
         review_scores_value, cancellation_policy) %>% 
#Converting characters to "doubles" and factors where appropriate
  mutate(neighbourhood_cleansed=factor(neighbourhood_cleansed),
         room_type=as.factor(room_type),
         price=parse_number(price),
         security_deposit=parse_number(security_deposit),
         cleaning_fee=parse_number(cleaning_fee),
         extra_people=parse_number(extra_people),
         cancellation_policy=as.factor(cancellation_policy),
         bed_type=as.factor(bed_type),
         prop_type_simplified = case_when( 
         property_type %in% c("Apartment","Hostel","Condominium","Serviced apartment", "Hotel", "Boat")~ property_type , TRUE ~ "Other"),
         prop_type_simplified=as.factor(prop_type_simplified))
```

Here is a description of some of the key variables in our dataset *hong_kong_listings*:

* `price` = cost per night
* `cleaning_fee`: cleaning fee
* `extra_people`: charge for having more than 1 person
* `property_type`: type of accommodation (House, Apartment, etc.)
* `room_type`:
- Entire home/apt (guests have entire place to themselves)
- Private room (Guests have private room to sleep, all other rooms shared)
- Shared room (Guests sleep in room shared with others)
* `number_of_reviews`: Total number of reviews for the listing
* `review_scores_rating`: Average review score (0 - 100)
* `neighbourhood*`: three variables on a few major neighbourhoods

```{r property types}
Property_type_summary <- hong_kong_listings%>%
  dplyr::group_by(prop_type_simplified)%>%
  dplyr::summarise(count = n())%>%
  dplyr::arrange(desc(count))

ggplot(Property_type_summary, aes(x = reorder(prop_type_simplified, count) , y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = "steelblue4") +
  #theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  labs(x = "Types of Property", 
     y = "Number of Properties", 
     title = "The different types of Airbnb properties in Hong Kong") 

```

As we can see, most of the properties available in Hong Kong's Airbnb market are apartments. There are also hotel rooms, condominiums and service apartments. Interestingly, there are also boats available for Airbnb in Hong Kong!

### Popular Districts

Now, let's look at what districts are the most popular for Airbnb properties.

```{r property_types_per_neighbourhood, warning=FALSE}

Neighbourhoods_summary <- hong_kong_listings%>%
  dplyr::group_by(neighbourhood_cleansed)%>%
  dplyr::summarise(count = n())%>%
  dplyr::arrange(desc(count))

ggplot(Neighbourhoods_summary, aes(x = reorder(neighbourhood_cleansed,count) , y = count)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = "slateblue") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  labs(x = "Districts", 
     y = "Number of Properties", 
     title = "Number of Properties in Different Districts") 

```

Intuitively, we can see that Wanchai, Central & Western and Yau Tsim Mong have the most Airbnb properties. This makes sense because Wanchai, Central & Western and Yau Tsim Mong are home to the two Central Business Districts of Hong Kong and are the most densely populated. 

But what are the types of proprties in these three districts? Are they mostly apartments?

```{r properties_by_district}

district_summary <- hong_kong_listings %>%
  dplyr::filter(neighbourhood_cleansed == c("Wan Chai", "Central & Western", "Yau Tsim Mong")) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(neighbourhood_cleansed, prop_type_simplified)%>%
  dplyr::summarise(count = n())%>%
  dplyr::arrange(desc(count))

ggplot(district_summary, aes(x = reorder(prop_type_simplified, count) , y = count, fill = neighbourhood_cleansed)) +
  facet_wrap(~neighbourhood_cleansed) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  labs(x = "Districts", 
     y = "Number of Properties", 
     title = "Number of Properties in Different Districts") 

```

For all three districts, we see that apartments are indeed the most popular types of Airbnb properties.

### Airbnb Ratings in the three most popular districts

How are the ratings distributed among the properties of the three most popular districts?

```{r ratings_distribution}
# Density plot of ratings by zones
top_3_districts_listings <- hong_kong_listings %>%
  dplyr::filter(neighbourhood_cleansed == c("Wan Chai", "Central & Western", "Yau Tsim Mong"))


ggplot(top_3_districts_listings, aes(x=review_scores_rating, fill=neighbourhood_cleansed, alpha = 0.3))+
  geom_density()+
  scale_alpha(guide = "none") +
  labs(title = "Density plot of ratings in Wan Chai, Central & Western and Yau Tsim Mong",
       x = "Ratings",
       y = "Density") +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 15, face = "bold"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
        legend.text = element_text(size=10))

```

### How do the prices differ between districts?

Finally, we analyze how airbnb prices differ in Hong Kong by district by using a box plot

```{r boxplot_prices}
# Boxplot of log(prices_4_night) by zones
ggplot(hong_kong_listings,
       aes(x=neighbourhood_cleansed, y = price,
           fill = neighbourhood_cleansed, alpha =0.5))+
  geom_boxplot()+  
  labs(title = "Boxplot of Total Price for One Night by Districts",
       x = "Districts",
       y = "Price") +
  theme(title = element_text(size = 15, face = "bold"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),
        legend.position = "none") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45)) +
  ylim(0,5000)     
```

Although, Central & Western and Yau Tsim Mong are the most popular districts for Airbnb properties, they do not command the highest prices on average. We instead see that the Southern district has the highest median price for a night. However, we also notice that Central & Western and Yau Tsim Mong have many outliers that command a much higher price than other properties in different districts.
