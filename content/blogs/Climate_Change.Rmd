Climate Change is the defining issue of our time and we are at the defining moment of our lives. The scope of the impacts of climate change are global and unprecedented in scale and it is our duty to take drastic action today to do as much as we can to protect our environment and keep our planet healthy.


## Climate Change: What does the data say?

To this day, there are still many that deny the effect of climate change. But what does the data say? Let's take a look at how temperatures have deviated from normal expected temperatures. 
Let's look at NASA's data of historical temperature anomalies.

```{r climate_change_data}
weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

weather <- weather %>% 
  select(Year, Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec)

tidyweather <- pivot_longer(weather, cols = 2:13,
                            names_to = "month",
                            values_to = "delta"
)

tidyweather
```

The variable delta is the temperature deviation from normal expected temperatures determined by NASA.

### Time-Series Scatter Plot

Let's look at the temperature deviations over time 

```{r scatterplot, warning= FALSE}

tidyweather <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Weather Anomalies",
    x= "Date",
    y= "Temperature Deviation"
  )

```

Next, let's analyze if temperature increases are more pronounced in specific months.

```{r deviation_month, warning=FALSE}

p1 <- ggplot(tidyweather, 
       aes(x=date, 
           y=delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="blue")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  facet_wrap(~ month, scales="free_y")+
  labs(title="Temperature Deviation has been increasing for the last 20 years",
       x="Date",
       y="Temperature Deviation")
#adding a horizontal line to see how far off our delta is from the expected value
 p1+ geom_hline(yintercept=0, color="red")+
  NULL

```

It is evident that posiitve temperature deviations occur in all months, and are steadily increasing over time!
Let's also examine the density plot for temperature deviations per month.

```{r time_month, warning=FALSE}
#month
ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=month))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density" , x = "Temperature Deviation"        #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )
```

### Different Time Periods

Let's look at the temperature deviations, if we group the data into five different time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present.

```{r time_periods, warning=FALSE}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

#intervals
ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +  #theme
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  labs (
    title = "Density Plot for Yearly Temperature Anomalies",
    y     = "Density" , x = "Temperature Deviation"
    #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )

```


### Average Annual Temperature Anomalies

```{r time_year, warning=FALSE}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  dplyr::summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Average Yearly Anomaly",
    y     = "Average Annual Delta", x = "Year"
  )                       

```

From the above plot, it is also quite evident that from 1960 onwards, there has been an increasing trend in temperature deviations and is slowly reaching an unprecendeted scale. Let's all work together, play our role, to keep our world a healthy and beautiful place!
