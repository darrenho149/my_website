## Movies

One of my absolute favourite things to do during my pastime is to sit down with my family and friends on a couch and put on a visually mesmerizing, thought provoking movie, with beer and popcorn flowing of course. Thus, I am extremely interested in analyzing movies and understanding all the different factors that come into play in the movie industry. Here, we will look in detail into the different genres of movies from IMDB, and analyze key figures such as their budget, ratings and gross earnings. 

### Let's take a look at the IMDB Movie Dataset
We can also look at the different variables of the dataset

```{r,load_movies, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

movies <- read.csv("~/Desktop/CA09 AUT 20 Data Analytics for Finance/GitHub/my_website/data/movies.csv")
glimpse(movies)

```

### How many movies of each genre do we have?

```{r movies_count}
movies <- movies %>%
          distinct(title, .keep_all = TRUE)

movies_count <- movies %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(genre) %>% 
  dplyr::summarize(Count = n())  
  
ggplot(movies_count, aes(x = reorder(genre, Count) , y = Count)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = "steelblue4") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=90)) +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  labs(x = "Genres", 
     y = "Number of Movies", 
     title = "Number of Movies per Genre") 

```

### Best Directors in the Business

Let's also look at which directors do best on average in the box office 

```{r First 15 by genre}

top_15_directors <- movies %>% 
                    group_by(director) %>% 
                    dplyr::summarize(total_gross=sum(gross), 
                              mean_gross=mean(gross), 
                              median_gross=median(gross), 
                              sd_gross=sd(gross)) %>% 
                    arrange(desc(total_gross)) %>% 
                    head(n=15)
  
top_15_directors

```

It's not surprising to see Steven Spielberg top the list with the highest total gross from all movies.  It's also interesting to note that although Christopher Nolan, James Cameron and George Lucas have lower total gross earnings, they have particularly high mean gross earnings! That's great to know since I am a massive Christopher Nolan and James Cameron fan. Did you get a chance to see Nolan's new movie TENET? It absolutely blew my mind. 

### What are the best genres?

Let's also look at how well each genre does with IMDB ratings

```{r Hist by genre}

rating_stat <- movies %>% 
               group_by(genre) %>% 
               summarise(mean_rating = mean(rating), 
                         med_rating = median(rating), 
                         min_rating = min(rating), 
                         max_rating = max(rating), 
                         sd_rating = sd(rating))

rating_hist <- ggplot(movies, aes(x=rating, fill = factor(genre))) +
                theme(legend.position = 'none') +
                geom_histogram() +
                theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
                facet_wrap(~genre, scales = "free_y") +
                labs(y = 'Number of Films', 
                     x = 'Rating',
                     title = 'Distribution of Ratings by Genre')

rating_hist

```

### Would IMDB Ratings be a good predictor for how well a movie does in the box office?

Here we examine the relationship between a movie's gross earnings and its IMDB Rating. 

```{r, gross_on_rating, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(movies, aes(y = gross, 
                        x = rating))+ 
     facet_wrap( ~ genre, scales = "free_y")+
     geom_point(alpha=0.3)+ 
     geom_smooth(method=lm)+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  labs(y = 'Gross Earnings', 
                     x = 'Rating',
                     title = 'Gross Earnings vs Ratings by Genre')

```

In general, we see that the higher the rating of the movie, the higher the gross earning of the movie. However, it's puzzling to see the exact oppposite for genres like Documentaries and Sci-Fi movies! From this graph, we actually see that the higher the ratings for these two genres, the lower the rating tends to be if we fit a linear relationship.

### Confidence Interval for Gross Earnings

Finally, let's create a 95% confidence interval for the 7 most popular movie genres in the IMDB Dataset

```{r confidence interval}

formula_ci <- movies %>% 
  filter(genre==c("Horror","Biography","Crime","Adventure","Drama","Comedy","Action")) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(genre) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(min_gross=min(gross),
            mean_gross=mean(gross),
            median_gross=median(gross),
            max_gross=max(gross),
            sd_gross=sd(gross),
            count=n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1),
            se_delta = sd(gross)/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_delta,
            delta_low = mean_gross - margin_of_error,
            delta_high = mean_gross + margin_of_error
  )
  
ggplot(formula_ci, aes(x=reorder(genre,mean_gross), y=mean_gross, colour=genre)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_errorbar(width=.5, aes(ymin=delta_low, ymax=delta_high)) + 
  labs(x=" ",
       y= "Gross Earnings", 
       title="95% Confidence Interval for Gross Earnings") + 
  theme_bw()+
  coord_flip()+
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels=scales::dollar_format())
 

```

We can see here that the genre Adventure has the highest average gross earnings. We can also see that Comedy has the narrowest interval for it's confidence interval which could be due to its smaller variance but also the number of movies of the genre in the dataset.
