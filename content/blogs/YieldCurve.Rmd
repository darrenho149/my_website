## The Yield Curve

The Yield Curve is simply the difference between short and long-term interest rates. It is important in the world of finance not only because it is used as a benchmark for other debt in the market, such as mortgages or bank lending rates, but also because it can be used to predict changes in economic output and overall growth. Here, we will download and attempt to analyze historical US yield rates of diffent maturities. In addition, we will also specifically track the yield curve, and explore whether the phenomenon of the "inverted yield curve", where long-term yields are lower than short-term yields, are able to forecast recessions, especially in a time such as the current world pandemic.


### Downloading monthly rates for historical yield curve rates for different durations

```{r get_rates, warning=FALSE}
# Get a list of FRED codes for US rates and US yield curve; choose monthly frequency
# to see, eg., the 3-month T-bill https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TB3MS
tickers <- c('TB3MS', # 3-month Treasury bill (or T-bill)
             'TB6MS', # 6-month
             'GS1',   # 1-year
             'GS2',   # 2-year, etc....
             'GS3',
             'GS5',
             'GS7',
             'GS10',
             'GS20',
             'GS30')  #.... all the way to the 30-year rate

# Turn  FRED codes to human readable variables
myvars <- c('3-Month Treasury Bill',
            '6-Month Treasury Bill',
            '1-Year Treasury Rate',
            '2-Year Treasury Rate',
            '3-Year Treasury Rate',
            '5-Year Treasury Rate',
            '7-Year Treasury Rate',
            '10-Year Treasury Rate',
            '20-Year Treasury Rate',
            '30-Year Treasury Rate')

maturity <- c('3m', '6m', '1y', '2y','3y','5y','7y','10y','20y','30y')

# by default R will sort these maturities alphabetically; but since we want
# to keep them in that exact order, we recast maturity as a factor 
# or categorical variable, with the levels defined as we want
maturity <- factor(maturity, levels = maturity)
```

We take a look at the list of yields we will peform our analysis on 

```{r look_at_the_types_of_yields}
# Create a lookup dataset
mylookup<-data.frame(symbol=tickers,var=myvars, maturity=maturity)
# Take a look:
mylookup %>% 
  knitr::kable()

df <- tickers %>% tidyquant::tq_get(get="economic.data", 
                   from="1960-01-01")   # start from January 1960
yield_curve <-left_join(df,mylookup,by="symbol")
```


### Let's take a look at Yields on US rates by duration since 1960

```{r yield_curve_1_plot}

yield_curve %>% 
mutate(var = factor(var, levels = unique(var))) %>% 
  #Plotting the graph with years on the x-axis and yields on the y-axis
ggplot(aes(x = date, y = price, color = as.factor(maturity))) +
#Facet_wrapping by maturity and var since the levels of maturity are ordered
    facet_wrap(var~ ., ncol = 2) + 
#Choosing the plot type to be a line graph
    geom_line() +
#Black and white theme
    theme_bw() +
#Setting the x-axis labels to be in date format in years
    scale_x_date(labels=date_format("%Y")) +
#Removing legend and bolding plot title
    theme(legend.position = "none", plot.title = element_text(face = "bold")) +
#Setting plot and axis titiles
    labs(y = '%', 
         title = 'Yields on U.S. Treasury rates since 1960', 
         caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)", x = "") 
```


### We can also look at monthly yields on US rates by duration since 1999 on a year-by-year basis

```{r yield_curve_2_plot}

#Creating new data frame with years >= 1999 and new year and month variables
yield_curve_with_years <- yield_curve %>% 
  filter(date>="1999-01-01") %>% 
   mutate(year = year(date), month = month(date))
    
#Plotting the graph with the different maturities on x-axis, yields on y-axis and grouping the yields by month
ggplot(yield_curve_with_years, 
       aes(x = maturity, 
           y = price, 
           color = as.factor(year), 
           group = month)) +
#Facet wrap the plot by year
    facet_wrap(~year, ncol = 4) +
#Choosing the plot to be a line graph 
    geom_line() +
#Choosing a black and white theme
    theme_bw() +
#Removing plot legend
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
#Setting plot labels
    labs(y = 'Yield (%)', title = 'US Yield Curve', caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)", x = "Maturity") +
#Bolding plot title
    theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
```

### Finally, we look at the yield curve by calculating the spread between the 10-year and 3-month yields

To add more context to our yield curve plot, we can also visualize the past recessions to see if there is a pattern. We look at the dates of the recessions from wikipedia and create a dataframe with all US recessions since 1946.

```{r setup_US-recessions, warning=FALSE}

# get US recession dates after 1946 from Wikipedia 
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_recessions_in_the_United_States

recessions <- tibble(
  from = c("1948-11-01", "1953-07-01", "1957-08-01", "1960-04-01", "1969-12-01", "1973-11-01", "1980-01-01","1981-07-01", "1990-07-01", "2001-03-01", "2007-12-01"),  
  to = c("1949-10-01", "1954-05-01", "1958-04-01", "1961-02-01", "1970-11-01", "1975-03-01", "1980-07-01", "1982-11-01", "1991-03-01", "2001-11-01", "2009-06-01") 
  )  %>% 
  mutate(From = ymd(from), 
         To=ymd(to),
         duration_days = To-From)

recessions
```

We then plot our yield curve graph. The grey areas in our plot refer to the recessions. The ribbons on our plot indicate whether the spread (10year - 3-month) is positive or negative.


```{r yield_curve_challenge_plot, out.width="100%"}

#Creating new data frame with only 3m and 10y maturities, pivoting wider and creating a new variable difference
yield_curve_final <- yield_curve %>% 
  filter((maturity == "3m" | maturity == "10y")) %>% 
  select(c("date","price","var")) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = "var", values_from = "price") %>% 
  mutate(difference=`10-Year Treasury Rate` - `3-Month Treasury Bill`)

#Plotting graph with date on the x-axis and the difference on the y-axis
ggplot(yield_curve_final, aes(x=date, y=difference)) +
#Choosing plot to be a line graph  
  geom_line() +
#Creating title and labels for graph
    labs(y = 'Difference (10 year-3 month) yield in %', title = 'Yield Curve Inversion: 10-year minus 3-month U.S. Treasury Rates', 
      caption = "Source: St. Louis Federal Reserve Economic Database (FRED)", 
      subtitle = "Difference in % points, monthly averages. \nShaded areas correspond to recessions", x="") +
#Selecting black and white theme
  theme_bw() +
#Fixing x-axis labels and limits
  scale_x_date(date_breaks="5 years",labels=date_format("%Y"), limits = c(as.Date("1959-01-01"),as.Date("2023-01-01"))) +
#Bolding plot title and removing legend
  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"), legend.position = "none") +
#Creating y-intercept line at 0
  geom_hline(yintercept=0,color="black") +
#Creating rugs at bottom of plot
  #geom_rug(aes(colour=ifelse(difference >= 0,"steelblue2","red")), sides="b",alpha=0.5, position = "jitter") +
#Plotting the recession grey areas on plot
  geom_rect(data=filter(recessions), inherit.aes=F, aes(xmin=From, xmax=To, ymin=-Inf, ymax=+Inf), fill='grey', alpha=0.7) +
#Plotting graph ribbons
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = difference, ymax = pmin(difference, 0)), fill= "steelblue2", alpha=0.5) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = 0, ymax = pmin(difference, 0)),fill = "red", alpha=0.5)

```

From the above plot, we can see that in six out of the seven times the yield curve inverts before 2020, a recession follows. This occurs in 1969, 1973, 1980, 1981, 2001 and 2007. In 2020, we once again see the yield curve invert. Is this a sign of a looming recession ahead?
